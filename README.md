# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles.

## Bootstrap (first time)

Run once on a new machine:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fei-Wang/dotfiles/main/bootstrap.sh)"
```

This bootstraps the repo and sets up the environment so the dotfiles command is available.

## Update (later)

After the first bootstrap, update/sync with:

```fish
dotfiles
```
